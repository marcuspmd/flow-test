# Flow Test Engine

A TypeScript-based API testing engine for writing rich, declarative flows in YAML. It supports request chaining, variable interpolation, flexible assertions, conditional scenarios, and clean reports in JSON and HTML.

Flow Test Engine is a language-agnostic runner for API suites written in YAML. You can bolt it onto any repositoryâ€”regardless of the tech stackâ€”to manage HTTP flows, capture variables, and publish reports.

## 1. Requirements

- Node.js 16 or newer (runtime used by Flow Test Engine)
- npm 8 or newer (ships with Node.js)
- Docker Desktop (optional, only if you want the bundled httpbin mock server)

ðŸ“Œ Install Node.js even if your application is written in another languageâ€”Flow Test Engine runs beside your project and never touches your runtime code.

## 2. Quick Start with `npx` (no install required)

Use `npx` to try the engine without adding dependencies:

```bash
# Initialise configuration and sample suites in the current directory
npx --yes flow-test-engine init
# or using the short form:
npx --yes fest init

# Execute all discovered suites using the generated config
npx --yes flow-test-engine --config flow-test.config.yml
# or using the short form:
npx --yes fest --config flow-test.config.yml
```

The wizard creates:
- `flow-test.config.yml` with discovery rules, retries, and reporting options.
- `tests/` containing starter YAML suites you can edit or replace.
- `results/` where execution artifacts are stored (`results/latest.json`).

## 3. Make Flow Test Part of Your Repository

For long-term use, keep Flow Test assets in their own workspace so teammates and CI can run them consistently.

```bash
mkdir flow-tests
cd flow-tests
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev flow-test-engine
npx flow-test-engine init
# or using the short form:
npx fest init
```

This produces a `flow-tests/package.json` similar to:

```json
{
  "name": "flow-tests",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "flow-test": "fest --config flow-test.config.yml",
    "flow-test:verbose": "fest --config flow-test.config.yml --verbose"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "flow-test-engine": "^1.0.2"
  }
}
```

A minimal suite (`flow-tests/tests/my-first-test.yaml`) might look like:

```yaml
suite_name: "Payment API Smoke"
base_url: "https://sandbox.my-api.com"

auth:
  type: "bearer"
  token: "{{$env.API_TOKEN}}"

steps:
  - name: "Get payment"
    request:
      method: "GET"
      url: "/payments/{{payment_id}}"
    assert:
      status_code: 200
      body:
        id: { equals: "{{payment_id}}" }
        status: { in: ["CREATED", "CONFIRMED"] }
```

Run it from anywhere in your repo:

```bash
npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test
# or, with npx
npx --yes --package flow-test-engine flow-test-engine --config flow-tests/flow-test.config.yml
# or using the short form:
npx --yes --package flow-test-engine fest --config flow-tests/flow-test.config.yml
```

## 4. Everyday CLI Patterns

```bash
fest --dry-run --detailed              # Discover tests and show plan
fest --suite auth,checkout             # Run specific suites
fest --priority critical,high          # Focus on high-impact scenarios
fest --tag smoke                       # Filter by YAML tags
fest --config ./flow-tests/staging.yml # Point to another config file
fest --report json,csv                 # Produce multiple report formats
```

## 5. Integration Recipes by Ecosystem

The commands below assume you created the dedicated `flow-tests/` workspace.

### Node.js / TypeScript projects

1. Install the engine next to your source:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev flow-test-engine
   npx flow-test-engine init
   # or using the short form:
   npx fest init
   ```
2. Add scripts to `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "flow-test": "fest --config flow-test.config.yml",
       "flow-test:ci": "fest --config flow-test.config.yml --report json"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Run locally or in CI:
   ```bash
   npm run flow-test
   npm run flow-test:ci
   ```

### PHP / Laravel (Composer)

1. Keep Flow Test files under `flow-tests/` as described earlier.
2. Reference that workspace from `composer.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "flow-test": "npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test",
       "flow-test:ci": "npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test -- --report=json"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Execute with Composer:
   ```bash
   composer run flow-test
   composer run flow-test:ci
   ```
4. In CI (GitHub Actions example):
   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: '18'
   - run: npm ci --prefix flow-tests
   - run: composer run flow-test:ci
   ```

### Java / Spring (Maven)

1. Ensure Node.js is available on the build agent.
2. Add a Maven execution in `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <plugin>
     <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
     <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     <version>3.1.0</version>
     <executions>
       <execution>
         <id>flow-tests</id>
         <phase>verify</phase>
         <goals><goal>exec</goal></goals>
         <configuration>
           <workingDirectory>${project.basedir}/flow-tests</workingDirectory>
           <executable>npx</executable>
           <arguments>
             <argument>fest</argument>
             <argument>--config</argument>
             <argument>flow-test.config.yml</argument>
           </arguments>
         </configuration>
       </execution>
     </executions>
   </plugin>
   ```
3. Run with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn verify
   ```

### Python / Django

Add a `Makefile` (or extend an existing one) so everyone runs the same command:

```makefile
# Makefile
flow-test:
	@npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test

flow-test-ci:
	@npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test -- --report=json
```

Usage:

```bash
make flow-test
make flow-test-ci
```

In a `tox.ini` you can also add:

```ini
[testenv:flow-tests]
commands = npm --prefix {toxinidir}/flow-tests run flow-test
```

### Dart / Flutter

Create `tool/flow_test.dart` to bridge into Node.js:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

Future<void> main() async {
  final result = await Process.start(
    'npx',
    ['--yes', 'fest', '--config', 'flow-tests/flow-test.config.yml'],
    mode: ProcessStartMode.inheritStdio,
  );
  final exitCode = await result.exitCode;
  if (exitCode != 0) {
    exit(exitCode);
  }
}
```

Add a script to `pubspec.yaml` (if you use `melos` or simple make targets):

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
scripts:
  flow-test: dart run tool/flow_test.dart
```

Run:

```bash
dart run tool/flow_test.dart
# or with the scripts plugin
dart run flow-test
```

### Pure Terminal / CI Pipelines

If your project has no build tool, keep it simple:

```bash
npm ci --prefix flow-tests             # install once in CI
npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test  # execute suites
```

Or run ad hoc:

```bash
npx --yes flow-test-engine --config flow-tests/flow-test.config.yml
# or using the short form:
npx --yes fest --config flow-tests/flow-test.config.yml
```

If you rely on Docker for dependent services, start them before running Flow Test. The sample `docker-compose.yml` in the Flow Test repository spins up httpbin:

```bash
docker compose up -d httpbin
npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test
docker compose down -v
```

## 6. Reporting and Dashboards

Every execution writes a JSON artifact at `flow-tests/results/latest.json`. When you need a shareable visualization, enable HTML output with the `--html-output` flag (optionally pass a subdirectory name) or by adding `html` to `reporting.formats` in `flow-test.config.yml`. The engine now emits a Postman-inspired HTML experience alongside the JSON, and the Astro dashboard packaged with this repository reads the same data, so keep it in sync before starting the UI.

1. Copy (or symlink) the latest results into the dashboard data folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p report-dashboard/src/data
   cp flow-tests/results/latest.json report-dashboard/src/data/latest.json
   # or keep it synced:
   ln -sf ../flow-tests/results/latest.json report-dashboard/src/data/latest.json
   ```
   The dashboard looks for the browser-facing file at `report-dashboard/src/data/latest.json`, while server-side rendering also checks `../results/latest.json`. If neither is present it automatically reads `reporting.output_dir` from your `flow-test.config.*` file to locate the latest report. Either path can be kept fresh in CI.
2. Launch the dashboard:
   ```bash
   npm install --prefix report-dashboard        # first run only
   npm run --prefix report-dashboard dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:4321/flow-test/` (Astroâ€™s default port). The UI reloads automatically when `src/data/latest.json` changes.
   - Prefer to serve it at the root path during local development? Run the command with `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=/ npm run --prefix report-dashboard dev` and open `http://localhost:4321/` instead.
3. Generate a static bundle when you need to publish the report:
   ```bash
   npm run --prefix report-dashboard build
   ```
   The build lands in `report-dashboard/dist/`. Deploy that folder and ship the matching `src/data/latest.json` (or automate a copy step) so the hosted dashboard can load the latest results.

Example CI step (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- run: npm ci --prefix flow-tests
- run: npm --prefix flow-tests run flow-test
- run: npm ci --prefix report-dashboard
- run: cp flow-tests/results/latest.json report-dashboard/src/data/latest.json
- run: npm run --prefix report-dashboard build
```
