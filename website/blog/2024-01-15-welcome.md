## Why Flow Test Engine?

Flow Test Engine was built to solve the complexity of modern API testing. Traditional testing tools often require extensive code setup, but our YAML-based approach makes tests:

- **Readable**: Clear, declarative syntax that anyone can understand
- **Maintainable**: Tests are configuration, not code
- **Powerful**: Advanced features like iterations, scenarios, and JavaScript expressions
- **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and existing workflows

## Example: Your First Test

Here's how simple it is to create a comprehensive API test:

```yaml
suite_name: "User API Test"
base_url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"

steps:
  - name: "Get user details"
    request:
      method: GET
      url: "/users/1"

    assert:
      status_code: 200
      body:
        id:
          equals: 1
        email:
          contains: "@"

    capture:
      username: "body.username"
      email: "body.email"

  - name: "Get user posts"
    request:
      method: GET
      url: "/users/1/posts"

    assert:
      status_code: 200
      body:
        length:
          greater_than: 0
```

## What's Coming Next

We're continuously improving Flow Test Engine. Here's what's on our roadmap:

- **Enhanced Swagger Integration**: More comprehensive test generation from API specs
- **Performance Testing**: Built-in load testing capabilities
- **Advanced Reporting**: Real-time dashboards and metrics
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom integrations
